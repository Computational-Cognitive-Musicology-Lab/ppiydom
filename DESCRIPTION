Description: Partial predictive modeling (PPM) has been applied widely to musical data using the IDyOM model.
    However, this model tends to be a bit hard to implement, and can be inscrutable and opaque (at least to me).
    Our goal is to make PPM for music faster and easier...and in R.
    Other attempts have been made in R, but our approach is more flexible and much faster.
